== DESCRIPTION:

Graph is a type of hash that outputs in graphviz's dot format. It
comes with a command-line interface that is easily pluggable.

It ships with plugins to graph dependencies and status of installed
rubygems, rake tasks, homebrew ports, mac ports, and freebsd ports,
coloring leaf nodes blue, outdated nodes red, and outdated leaf nodes
purple (red+blue).

OSX quick tip: 

    % sudo gem install graph --development
    % sudo brew install graphviz
    % gem unpack graph
    % cd graph*
    % sudo gem install hoe
    % rake gallery
    % open gallery/*.png

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Very clean DSL interface and API.
* Saves to dot and can automatically convert to png (or whatever).
* graph, edge, and node attributes are easy to set.
* bin/graph includes a caching mechanism for slower fairly static data.

== SYNOPSIS:

    digraph do
      # many ways to access/create edges and nodes
      edge "a", "b"
      self["b"]["c"]
      node("c") >> "a"

      square   << node("a")
      triangle << node("b")

      red   << node("a") << edge("a", "b")
      green << node("b") << edge("b", "c")
      blue  << node("c") << edge("c", "a")

      save "simple_example", "png"
    end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* hoe

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install graph
